  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>The rising threat of climate change has made it vital for individuals and organizations to understand and reduce their environmental impact. The Eco Footprint Counter is a simple yet powerful tool designed to help users measure their carbon emissions based on daily activities like driving, electricity consumption, and air travel. By quantifying our eco footprints, we take the first step toward environmental awareness and action.</p>

  <p>Unlike traditional environmental surveys that require expert help and lengthy procedures, the Eco Footprint Counter offers an accessible, easy-to-use platform. It translates complex calculations into a user-friendly format suitable for students, educators, professionals, and environmental enthusiasts. It not only informs but also motivates sustainable practices by making the invisible impacts of our actions visible.</p>

  <p>With the Eco Footprint Counter, users are empowered to make informed lifestyle changes, set reduction goals, and track their progress over time. It is more than just a calculator — it is a stepping stone toward global sustainability and responsible citizenship.</p>
